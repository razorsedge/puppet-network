Introduction
------------

This module manages Red Hat/Fedora traditional network configuration.

It allows for static, dhcp, and bootp configuration of normal and bonded interfaces as well as bridges and VLANs.  There is support for aliases on interfaces as well as alias ranges.  It can configure static routes.  It can configure MTU, DHCP_HOSTNAME, ETHTOOL_OPTS, and BONDING_OPTS on a per-interface basis.

It can configure the following files:

* /etc/sysconfig/network
* /etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/route-*
* /etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/ifcfg-*

Class and Define documentation is available via puppetdoc.

    }

Static interface routes:

    network::route { 'eth0':
      ipaddress => [ '192.168.2.0', '10.0.0.0', ],

    }

Normal interface - VLAN - static (minimal):

      ensure    => 'up',
      ipaddress => '10.2.3.248',
      netmask   => '255.255.255.0',
    }

Flush IP addresses:

Network scripts on RHEL7 do not flush IP addresses, so you eventually end up with multiple of them, passing `flush => true` will run `ip addr flush` on given interface before notifying the network service.

    network::if::static { 'eth0':
      ensure    => 'up',
      ipaddress => '1.2.3.4',
      netmask   => '255.255.255.0',
      flush     => true,
    }

Restart network:

By default, all changes notify the network service, thus triggering a restart of the whole networking configuration. This might be not desired in some setups and can be disabled by passing the `restart` parameter as `false`:

    network::if::static { 'eth0':
      ensure    => 'up',
      ipaddress => '1.2.3.4',
      netmask   => '255.255.255.0',
      restart   => false,
    }

Hiera
-----

Hiera can be enabled for all defines by including the hiera class in code:

    include network::hiera

With this include enabled, configuration both in Hiera and in code will be applied.

For example, to configure `network::alias` via Hiera:

    network::alias:
      'eth0:1':
        ensure: up
        ipaddress: 1.2.3.4
        netmask: 255.255.255.0

The Hiera naming substitutes underscore for any secondary double colons, i.e. specify `network::bond::static` as `network::bond_static` in hiera:

    network::bond_static:
      bond0:
        ensure: up
        ipaddress: 1.2.3.4
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
        bonding_opts: 'mode=1 miimon=1000'

Notes
-----

* Runs under Puppet 2.7 and later.
* Only works with RedHat-ish systems.
* Read /usr/share/doc/initscripts-*/sysconfig.txt for underlying details.
* Read /usr/share/doc/kernel-doc-*/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt for underlying details.
* Read /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-aliases for underlying details.
* Only tested on CentOS 5.5 and CentOS 6.3.
* There is an assumption that an aliased interface will never use DHCP.
* bootp support is unknown for bonded interfaces. Thus no bootp bond support in this module.
* It is assumed that if you create a bond that you also create the slave interface(s).
* It is assumed that if you create an alias that you also create the parent interface.
* network::route requires the referenced device to also be defined via network::if or network::bond.
* For VLANs to work, `Class['network::global']` must have parameter `vlan` set to `yes`.
* To enable IPv6 you have to set both `ipv6networking` in `Class['network::global']` to `true` and `ipv6init` in `network::if::static` to `true`.

Issues
------

* Setting ETHTOOL_OPTS, MTU, or BONDING_OPTS and then unsetting will not revert the running config to defaults.
* Changes to any configuration will by default result in "service network restart".  This could cause network inaccessability for the host if the network configuration is incorrect. See the examples how to disable this behaviour.
* Modifying or creating a slave interface after the master has been created will not change the running config.
* There is presently no support for removing an interface.

TODO
----

* Support /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-\<interface-name\>
* Expand support for IPv6.
* Support for more than Ethernet links.
* Testing of VLAN support (it should Just Work(TM)).

See TODO.md for more items.

Deprecation Warning
-------------------

The define `network::global` will be replaced by a paramterized class in version 3.0.0 of this module.  Please be aware that your manifests may need to change to account for the new syntax.

This:

    network::global { 'default':
      # blah
    }

would become this:

    class { 'network::global':
      # blah
    }

The define `network::if::alias` and `network::bond::alias` will be merged into `network::alias` in version 3.0.0 of this module.  Please be aware that your manifests may need to change to account for the new syntax.

This:

    network::if::alias { 'eth0:1':
      # blah
    }

would become this:

    network::alias { 'eth0:1':
      # blah
    }

The define `network::route` will have parameter `address` renamed to `ipaddress` in version 3.0.0 of this module.  This is for the purpose of consistency with all the other defines in the `network` class.  Please be aware that your manifests may need to change to account for the new syntax.

This:

    network::route { 'eth0':
      address => '192.168.17.0',
      # blah
    }

would become this:

    network::route { 'eth0':
      ipaddress => '192.168.17.0',
      # blah
    }
